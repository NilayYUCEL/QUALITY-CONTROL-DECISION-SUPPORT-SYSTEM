# QUALITY-CONTROL-DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM

Within the scope of the project, the reports of the institutions/companies that 
make mass production as a result of the quality control systems will be interpreted. 
At the same time, a machine learning application will be made that will minimize the 
erroneous or incomplete decisions made by the employees. Within the scope of the 
data to be examined, the evaluation of the erroneous measurements resulting from 
the quality control will be made and as a result of this evaluation, it will be decided 
whether the production will be stopped or not. In this way, the financial loss that will 
occur due to unnecessarily stopping the production in the factories or not stopping 
the production, when necessary, will be prevented.

The products produced, how the quality control of these products is done, the 
maintenance to be done after the production is stopped, the conditions under which 
the production will be continued, technical measurements will not be discussed 
within the scope of the project. According to the result of the model trained within 
the scope of the project, a machine learning application will be made about when the 
production will be stopped or not. In this way, both the number of faulty production 
and the factors causing faulty production will be minimized, and it will be possible to 
intervene immediately when the production is faulty.
